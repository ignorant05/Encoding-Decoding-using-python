# Encoding-Decoding-using-python
Here you can find some encoding and decoding python scripts to run them directly from the terminal : 

Run this command-line in your terminal : python3 <file-name.py> '<text-to-enc/dec>'

(Note: -the single quotes used to get the full string even if it contains spaces

      -if you want to use double quotes instead, make sure to use the "\\" before every special character)

Exmample : python3 Base64ToAscii.py 'SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ'
>>>The output will be : Hello, World!
